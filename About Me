        <h1>About me (Sattapriyo Kamal)</h1>
        <p>I am Sattapriyo Kamal, I am a 14 year old from both Bangladesh and Sudan. I currently live in Sweden with my family
            <br> I really like computers, I find them interesting. I really would love to know how to code because I think it seems like a nice skill to learn. It also is a very high paying profession, so it's very, very valuable. I think it is good to learn now because of the current AI craze. It is probably the best time to start learning coding.
        </p>

        <p>I might have spoken alot about my reasons on why I should learn coding, well I think I should speak more about my personal life. I go to IES Solna, an english privately owned school, not a private school. By "privately owned" I mean that the school is owned by a private company, but the school is free to go to.
            <br> I have a lot of friends in school, I am quite the social guy, man. </p>
